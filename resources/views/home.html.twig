        <p class="quote">The Greek word for philosopher (<em>philosophos</em>) connotes a distinction from <em>sophos</em>. It
            signifies
            the lover of wisdom (knowledge) as distinguished from him who considers himself wise in the possession of
            knowledge. This meaning of the word still endures: the essence of philosophy is not the possession of the
            truth
            but the search for truth. â€¦ Philosophy means to be on the way. Its questions are more essential than its
            answers, and every answer becomes a new question.
