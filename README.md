First project with Silex and php7

The projects has three pages:

*Discover* - it fetches a random article from Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, shows its intro, and table of contents.

![discover](https://github.com/Witoso/dailyphilosophy/blob/master/readme_assets/discover.gif?raw=true)

*Meet* - gets names from DB, and gets information about the person in the Knowledge Graph

![meet](https://github.com/Witoso/dailyphilosophy/blob/master/readme_assets/meet.gif?raw=true)

*Read* - read a book, and bookmark the part where you've finished

![read](https://github.com/Witoso/dailyphilosophy/blob/master/readme_assets/read.gif?raw=true)


To Do:
- add more books, and more philosophers
- better handle exceptions from third party libraries
- add functional test for all Controllers

Ideas:
- ~~random article from stanford encyclopedia of philosophy~~ (DONE)
- ~~discover philosophers (knowledge graph) -> database with names~~ (DONE)
- ~~read books (bookmarks)~~ (DONE)
